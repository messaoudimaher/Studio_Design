## 🎨 BLOG REMOVED ✓

As requested, the blog section has been completely removed from:

- ✓ Navigation menu

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### Your Images Are BMP Format
**Issue:** BMP files are HUGE (each is 10-50 MB!)
- `cam 1.bmp` = 48 MB 😱
- `cam 2.bmp` = 52 MB 😱

**Solution Needed:** Convert to WebP or JPEG
- WebP = 90% smaller (5 MB → 500 KB)
- Better web performance
- Faster loading

**Next Steps:** I can create a conversion script for you.

---

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS AFTER PREVIEW

### Immediate:
1. ✅ Preview the site (you're doing this now!)
2. ⏳ Build the portfolio grid with your real images
3. ⏳ Convert BMP to web-optimized formats
4. ⏳ Create project detail pages

### Soon:
- Update other pages (about.html, services.html, etc.)
- Add testimonials section
- Optimize images
- Set up hosting

## 💬 FEEDBACK CHECKLIST
